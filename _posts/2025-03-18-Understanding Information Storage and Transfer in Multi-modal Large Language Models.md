# Introduction
 **Information storage**: how facts from a pre-training dataset are stored in a model’s parameters – its so-called ‘parametric’ memory.
 **Information transfer**: how information from input prompts are propagated through information storage locations to the model’s final output.
 **constraint-based formulation**: A visual question as having a set of either visual or textual constraints. This formulation offers a systematic way of understanding a model’s behavior.
\n e.g. What movie directed by *this director* has won *a Golden Globe*?
